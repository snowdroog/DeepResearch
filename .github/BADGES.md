## Badge Colors

Badges automatically update their color based on status:
- ðŸŸ¢ Green: Passing/Success
- ðŸ”´ Red: Failing
- ðŸŸ¡ Yellow: Pending/In Progress
- âš« Gray: No runs yet

## Refreshing Badges

Badges update automatically but may be cached:
- GitHub caches badges for a few minutes
- Hard refresh your browser (Ctrl+F5 / Cmd+Shift+R) to see latest
- Badges reflect the latest workflow run for the specified branch

## Preview

Before committing, you can preview badges by:
1. Creating a test PR
2. Waiting for workflows to run
3. Checking badge appearance in PR description
